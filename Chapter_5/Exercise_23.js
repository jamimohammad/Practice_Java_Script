//  *5.23 (Demonstrate cancellation errors) A cancellation error occurs when you are 
// manipulating a very large number with a very small number. The large number 
// may cancel out the smaller number. For example, the result of 100000000.0 + 
// 0.000000001 is equal to 100000000.0. To avoid cancellation errors and obtain 
// more accurate results, carefully select the order of computation. For example, in 
// computing the following series, you will obtain more accurate results by comput
// ing from right to left rather than from left to right:
//  1 + 1
//  2 + 1
//  3 + c + 1
//  n
//  Write a program that compares the results of the summation of the preceding 
// series, computing from left to right and from right to left with n = 50000.

let n = Number(prompt("enter a number"));

let left = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    left += 1 / i;
}

let right = 0;
for (let i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
    right += 1 / i;
}

console.log("Left " + left);
console.log("Right " + right);
